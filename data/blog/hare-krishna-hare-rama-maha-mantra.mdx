Hare Krishna mantra is a 16-word mantra composed of the Three holy names of the Supreme God; “Hare”, “Krishna” and “Rama”. It is mentioned in the Kali-Santarana Upanishad from the Krishna Yajur Veda which asserts it to be the Maha Mantra (Supreme mantra) of the current era(the Kalyuga) because it destroys all the ordeals of the Kalyuga.

#### **Meaning of the Hare Krishna Mantra**

“Hare” refers to “Shri Radha Rani” (Lord’s eternal consort). Radha is the “Energy of the Lord” (Krishna’s Shakti).  
“Krishna” is a name of the Supreme Lord meaning “the All-Attractive One”.  
“Rama” is another name of the Lord meaning “the Source of All Pleasure”.  
So, by chanting the mantra we say “O Lord Krishna, O energy of Krishna, please employ me in your service”. It can be noted that “Hare” has been repeated 8 times in the mantra because it is known that one can approach Krishna only through His energy – Shri Radha. So, the Hare Krishna mantra is a request to Shri Radha to allow us to be engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord, Krishna.
